      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm Kaiya, a 19 year old student born and raised in Tacoma, WA. I live here with my dog, Texas Red. I was originally a biomedicine student before I realized that I did not have the money or passion to go to medical school, so now I'm searching for a new passion in life!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Tacoma, Washington. I was born here and have only moved twice in my life (to different houses in Tacoma).</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like hiking, gaming, and cooking! I also can be found roller skating around Point Ruston when the weather is nice.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Originally, I wanted to go into forensics, but my goals have changed and now I'm looking for a new type of career in the tech industry.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I know, you guys will never guess..... Tacome Washington.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I was excited to try a new skill that I had never even considered before, and the idea of a whole new realm of knowledge was just so exciting that I had to learn it all. I'm not sure career-wise, but I already sit at my computer all day anyways, so why not make it productive?</p>
